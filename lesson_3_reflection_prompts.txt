When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share my work with other contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I may want to discard any changes I made in remote repository. I'd like to manually control this process.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is a local copy of GitHub repository. I use git clone when I want to work and commit on my PC.
    I use branch when I want to develop a new set of features of my program, but want to keep an original.
    I use fork when I need to make my own project based on somebody's project, without having to clone it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
